    "+ **Date**: is a custom `data` type representing the information of the date when a libray user borrows a publication,or the date of birth of the main authors, or the release date of a publication, or the expected return date of a publication to the library. It includes 3 fields for the day, month and year, both day and year are of type `Int` and month is of type `String`. It includes deriving, a `Haskell feature` to automatically allow two Date values to be compared for equality ir viceversa.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "+ **Person** is a custom `data` representing the publications author's information, it includes three fields: name and surname of type `String`and birth of type **Date**, representing the users date of birth. The type includes deriving as previously explained in **Date** to automatically compare two **Person** values for equality or viceversa<br><br>\n",
    "+ **Signature** is a `newtype` wrapper around the `Int` type, used to represent the unique signature of a publication, it adds **type safety**, distinguishing **Signature** from other `Int` values, avoiding runntime overhead. The wrapper includes `deriving` for once again allowing autatic comparisons of **Signature** values\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "+ **UserId** is a `newtype` wrapper around the `Int` type, representing the unique identifier of a library user. Similar to **Signature**, the use of `newtype` ensure **type safery** and keeps performance effcient. It also includes deriving (Eq) to enable equality check for the wrapper.<br><br>\n",
    "+ **Publication** is custom `data` type representing the various kinds of publications that the library has. It is a `sum` type with three possible `constructors`.<br><br>\n",
    "  + **Book** is a `constructor` with four items including; signature of type **`Signature`**, representing the unique id for the book, a title of type `String` representing thr book's title, an author of type **`Person`**, and lastly numberPages of type `Int`, prepresenting the total number of pages in the book<br><br>\n",
    "  + **Paper** is a `constructor` with 5 items including; signature, title, and numberPages, previously detailed in Book, authors of type `[`**`Person`**`]`, which is a list, since there might be a list of authors who contributed to a single paper, releaseDate of type **`Date`**, representing when the paper was published.<br><br>\n",
    "  + **DVD** is a `constructor` consisting of 6 items including; signature, title, releaseDate, previously detailed in **Paper** and **Book**, with additional feaures such as director of type **`Person`**, representing the director of the **DVD**, actors which would be equavalent to the list of authors of a paper, movies include several actors, hence it is of type `[`**`Person`**`]`, i.e, a list of actors and lastly duration of type `Int`, which would be the equivakent to numberPages in **Book**, but representing the runtime of the DVD in minutes.<br><br>\n",
    "The type uses derinving(Eq) to allow for equality comparisons between two Publication values by checking their respective fields.<br><br>\n",
    "+ **UserType** is a `data` type representing the roles of the library users. It has two possible values: **StudentType** and **ProfessorType**.<br><br>\n",
    "+ **User** is a custom `data` type representing these users, including three fields; userId of type **`UserId`**, person of type **`Person`** and userType of type **`UserType`**, all previously detailed.<br><br>\n",
    "+ **Borrowing** is a `data` type representing the action of bowwowing a publication from the library. It includes three items; borrower of type **`User`**, loanDate of type **`Date`**, which saved the date when a publication was borrowed, and lastly returnDate of type **`Date`** with the expected return date for the borrowed publication.<br><br>\n",
    "+ **Copy** is a `data` type representing a specific physical copy of a publication in the library. It contains two items; copyId of type `Int`, working as a unique identifier for the copy and bowwowing of type `Maybe`**`Borrowing`**, an optional field indicating whether the copy is currently borrowed, `Just`**`Borrowing`** or available `Nothing`.<br><br>\n",
    "+ **CatalogEntry** is a `data` type representing an entry in the library's catalog. It includes publication of type **`Publication`** and copues of type `[`**`Copy`**`]`, a list of all the copies of the publications available in the library.<br><br>\n",
    "+ **Catalog** is a `newtype` wrapper around `[`**`CatalogEntry`**`]` representing the entire library catalog as a list of catalog entries"
