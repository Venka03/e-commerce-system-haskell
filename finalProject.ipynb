    "This project builds a small e-commerce system in Haskell. It models the main parts of an online shop using well-defined types: **Category** and **Product** describe what the shop sells, **Customer** and **LoyaltyLevel** show who is buying and which discounts apply, **CartItem** and **ShoppingCart** represent what the customer wants to buy, **Stock** stores available quantities, and **Order** combines all of this with a **Status**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discounts are handled through the *Discountable* type class. Both **LoyaltyLevel** and **Category** are instances of this class, so the final price of each item is obtained by applying both discounts in order. The function `calculateOrderTotal` then adds everything together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system also checks correctness. Equality for **Product** and **Customer** is based on their identifiers, stock is verified through `stockQuantity` and `checkStock`, and `createOrder` ensures that orders with missing items are rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order progress is controlled by the **Status** type. The function `transitionAllowed` defines which changes are valid, and `updateOrderStatus` returns a new order only when the transition is permitted, using `Maybe` to represent success or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project also includes a small search module. Orders can be filtered using different criteria such as customer id, loyalty level, product id, category, or total price. High-value customers are identified using helper functions like `activeOrders`, `customersOf`, `uniq`, and `totalOfCustomer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these pure functions are meant to be combined with I/O so users can search products, manage carts, place orders, and so that shop owners can inspect customers and process pending orders."

When the loop ends, `cartHandler` decides what to do: if the cart is empty, it only saves updated customers and stock and exits; if the cart has items, it tries to place an order using `placeOrderIO`. In case of failure, `orderResult` reports that the order failed and saves only customer and stock data as they were before the attempt.

    "The project was fun combined with struggle, but we managed to complete the required tasks and additionally got creative, decided it could be more user friendly, and managed to elevate the project to everything we wanted to achieve, such as new customer registration or identifying oneself as either customer or owner. We believe that this project helped us a lot to understand better Haskell as a language but additionally its application, because personally me (Ivan) did not believe that something comprehensive like this can be done using functional programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was interesting to explore and use Haskell functions that do not appear in other languages and to master recursion as well as exhaustive pattern matching (specifically in the order's status transitions). Additionally it was involving to study recommendations provided by Jupyter, as some of them allowed much simpler and more \"beautiful\" solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the problems we faced were in general idea how to do some functionality without classes and their methods (like the ones in OOP) and especially without variables and cycles (in common understanding), as we got used to those paradigms of programming and now we had to adapt. A clear key lesson was learning to avoid imperative habits. Refactoring the stock logic for example taught me (Isa) something similar. The preliminary version relied on a global stock variable, which made the program dependent making it awkward and conceptually incorrect. Rewriting `checkStock` to depend only on its explicit arguments removed hidden state and resulted in a cleaner and more general design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally me (Ivan), did not like that some functionality is limited (due to my lack of knowledge or limitations of Haskell in comparison to other languages), like for examples limitation of constructor, we cannot directly while creation an \"object\", check values of parameters, like ids or quantities, as theoretically they can be set to negative values, so this is something I did not like, although we can use auxiliary functions to control that, still it is something that did not leave me calm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The I/O system was the most demanding part. Handling user interaction, typed input, file updates, and error paths required many trial-and-error compiles. We also relied heavily on double recursion to manage the interaction loops, especially for the manager side of the system. Double recursion turned out to be one of the most powerful tools in the project: it allowed us to structure repeated choices, return paths, and nested flows in a clean and purely functional way. However, this strength also exposed a practical limitation. Jupyter executes Haskell code incrementally, cell by cell, and because our recursive functions called each other in both directions, Jupyter could not resolve them unless they all appeared together. The only way to make the system runnable in that environment was to place all mutually recursive I/O functions into a single cell. This was a clear example of how functional programming encourages elegant recursive designs, while Jupyter’s execution model is not aligned with that style. Moving the project to .hs files solved the issue and showed us how Haskell I/O programs are actually meant to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the main challenges were conceptual: modelling state without variables, working with pure functions, and understanding why constructors cannot enforce validation as in OOP. Even though auxiliary functions solve these issues, the adjustment required time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me (Isa), it was a privilege to have Ivan as my peer for this project. I truly learned a lot, and it is rare to reach such a strong level of understanding and coordination, specially in university projects. I believe the success of this project came from our clear communication and the genuine investment we both put into the work. Neither of us tried to overshadow the other; instead, we approached every task with real teamwork. We made sure that each of us understood the other’s individual implementations, which allowed us to build such a robust and coherent system."
