    "This project builds a small e-commerce system in Haskell. It models the main parts of an online shop using well-defined types: **Category** and **Product** describe what the shop sells, **Customer** and **LoyaltyLevel** show who is buying and which discounts apply, **CartItem** and **ShoppingCart** represent what the customer wants to buy, **Stock** stores available quantities, and **Order** combines all of this with a **Status**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discounts are handled through the *Discountable* type class. Both **LoyaltyLevel** and **Category** are instances of this class, so the final price of each item is obtained by applying both discounts in order. The function `calculateOrderTotal` then adds everything together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system also checks correctness. Equality for **Product** and **Customer** is based on their identifiers, stock is verified through `stockQuantity` and `checkStock`, and `createOrder` ensures that orders with missing items are rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order progress is controlled by the **Status** type. The function `transitionAllowed` defines which changes are valid, and `updateOrderStatus` returns a new order only when the transition is permitted, using `Maybe` to represent success or failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project also includes a small search module. Orders can be filtered using different criteria such as customer id, loyalty level, product id, category, or total price. High-value customers are identified using helper functions like `activeOrders`, `customersOf`, `uniq`, and `totalOfCustomer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these pure functions are meant to be combined with I/O so users can search products, manage carts, place orders, and so that shop owners can inspect customers and process pending orders."
